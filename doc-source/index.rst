Welcome to turkit2's documentation!
===================================

**Currently in development**

*Human computation* is the concept of treating human work as a *unit of algorithmic computation*.
Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a platform that can enable human computation --
a programmer can hire anonymous workers to perform tasks, such as (image or text) labeling, tagging, and segmentation.

**Turkit2** is a Python library that aims to make human computation easier.
Turkit2 allows a programmer to easily
create (or reuse existing) static webpage templates that allow workers to do work,
recruit workers, and retrieve the work done by workers.

A typical workflow is as follows.

#. A programmer wants to embed human work into their program, e.g.human-in-the-loop methodologies such as active learning, or crowd workflows such as Soylent.
#. The programmer designs an interface for a human in their program.
#. The programmer builds **task object** for their interface. Read more about :ref:`Task Objects`.
#. The programmer uses their task object in their program.

Turkit2 is built on top of the low level AWS API boto3, and uses Jinja2 for its templating mechanism.
